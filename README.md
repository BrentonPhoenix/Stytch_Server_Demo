This is the server side, a client side exists [Stytch Demo Client](https://github.com/BrentonPhoenix/Stytch_Server_Demo)

This project is not currently deployed.


This project is intended to represent a basic competence with Stytch Authentication. It could benefit from some expansion in functionality, but I have other skills to pick up at this time so expansion has been tabled for now.

Future Expansion:
- Further Routes
- Database connection(possible)
